    <h1>Coffees</h1>
    <p>At Hot Liquids you will always find a good selection of really delicious completely freshly roasted specialty coffee in many flavors. 
      We only sell coffee beans of the highest quality, so if you are looking for freshly roasted filter or espresso coffee, have a look at our large selection. With us, you also have the opportunity to buy raw / green coffee beans if you think it's fun to roast your coffee yourself.
      Freshly roasted coffee tastes a lot better, and therefore you can buy raw coffee beans on this page, so you can roast the beans for your coffee yourself. The advantage of having to roast them yourself is that you decide for yourself how the coffee beans are to be roasted and thus taste. So whether you are mostly for a light roast, between roasting or dark roasting, it is you who is in control. In addition, you can also add flavors you love and thus produce your very own specialty coffee.
